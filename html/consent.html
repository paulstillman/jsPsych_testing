	<hr>

	<p>You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully.</p>

	<h2>Purpose of the research:</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of how humans make decisions.</p>

	<h2>Study Procedures:</h2>
		<p>You may be asked to complete one or more tasks that focus on aspects of learning and decision making. We may ask you to complete a number of self-report questionnaires meant to gauge your emotions, personality, attitudes, behavior, and to record information about your recent experience. We may ask you to have a conversation with another participant or an artificial intelligence “chatbot” about emotional topics (e.g., negative and positive emotions in your life). If you decide to participate in this study, please understand that your participation is voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time for any reason. You will receive $2.50 for your participation, based on typical completion times and prorated for partial hours, including any bonuses due to task performance. The entire experiment will be conducted online on your own computerized device in a place of your choosing. The research will sometimes involve multiple sessions, with each session not expected to last longer than two hours, and with much shorter sessions being typical.</p>

	<h2>Benefits and Risks:</h2>
		<p>It is important that you understand that there is no direct benefit to you anticipated from your participation in this study, however we hope that our results will help to increase our understanding of human decision making. It is possible but unlikely that this task may cause you discomfort, fatigue, or find some topics distressing. To minimize risk, you will be given breaks and are free to withdraw at any time without any loss of payment. Although the study materials are selected to avoid highly emotional or evocative stimuli, there is a small risk that you may have an adverse reaction while completing aspects of the study. There is a slight chance you may feel frustrated or uncomfortable if a task is difficult, and you are free to discontinue your participation in the study if you choose without any loss of payment.</p>

	<h2>Alternatives:</h2>
		<p>The alternative to participating in this particular study is to not participate.</p>

	<h2>Confidentiality:</h2>
		<p>All of your responses will be held in confidence. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight (such as representatives of the Yale University Human Research Protection Program, the Yale University Institutional Review Boards, and others) will have access to any information that could identify you that you provide. We will share it with others if you agree to it or when we have to do it because U.S. or State law requires it. For example, we will tell somebody if we learn that you are hurting a child or an older person.</p>

		<p>Completion of this study is anonymous. We will not know your name. We will not be able to connect any identifying information to your responses. However, your account is associated with an ID for the online testing platform (e.g., Prolific, Amazon Mechanical Turk) that the researcher may have to see in order to pay you and in order to link your data from multiple sessions. This ID could possibly be connected to your public profile, which could, in theory, be searched. We want to stress that we will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles. We will keep the information about your participation in this research confidential.</p>
